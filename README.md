# ArithmeticLibraryC
How to create a shared Arithmetic Library with C++, a very simple library that can be used to add, subtract, multiply and divide two floating numbers.

Assuming you are using Linux OS (we are using GFreya OS 1.8 based on Linux From Scratch System V version 11.0)

## How to Create the Shared Library

Type in the working directory that contain all the header and cpp files to be made into shared library: (arithmetic.h and arithmetic.cpp):
```
g++ -fPIC -c arithmetic.cpp
g++ -shared -o libarithmetic.so arithmetic.o
```
After you create *.so shared library then move it to /usr/lib.

## How to Use the Shared Library

Type in the working directory that contain all the cpp files to be made into shared library: (main.cpp):
```
g++ main.cpp -larithmetic -o out
./out
```

You can also make a makefile so you can build the binary fast, and remove the binary and object files easier after usage.
